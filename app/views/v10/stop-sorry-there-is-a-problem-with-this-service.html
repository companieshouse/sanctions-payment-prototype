          You can pay your penalty by bank transfer.
        
         <p>Use the correct bank details for your penalty. There are different bank details depending on whether your penalty reference starts with A, P or U.

  If you’ve paid by bank transfer before, your bank may automatically use the same bank account and it might not be correct. Check you’re paying to the correct bank account for your penalty reference.

     Companies House
     <br>PO Box 710
