<!-- Another way -->
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
       Other ways to pay
      </h2>

      <p>
        You can pay by:
       </p>
   
       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
         <li>bank transfer</li>
         <li>cheque (late filing penalties only)</li>
       </ul>
  
    
      <!-- Bacs -->
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Pay by bank transfer</h3>
  
      <p>
       You can pay using Bacs payment. You'll need to use the account details shown on your penalty notice.
      </p>
  
      <p>
       It usually takes up to 3 working days for your payment to reach Companies House. Check your bank's transaction limits and processing times before making a payment.
      </p>
  
  
  <!-- Cheque -->
     <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Pay by cheque (late filing penalties only)</h3>
  
     <p>You can pay a late filing penalty by cheque, through the post. Make the cheque payable to ‘Companies House only’ and send it along with the slip on the penalty notice (‘remittance advice’) to Companies House.
     </p>
  
     <div class="govuk-inset-text">
       Companies House
       <br>PO Box 710
       <br>Crown Way
       <br>CF14 3UZ
     </div>
  
     <p>Write the company name and number on the back of the cheque. You’ll find the company number on your penalty notice.
     </p>
    </div>
